## Development

GrapesJS uses [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) as a module bundler and [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) as a compiler.

Clone the repository and install all the necessary dependencies

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ckhandla94/html-template-builder.git
$ cd html-template-builder
$ npm i
```

Start the dev server

```sh
$ gulp watch

Once the development server is started you should be able to reach the demo page (eg. `http://localhost:3000`)
